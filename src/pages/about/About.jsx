          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <h5>
            Hello my name is <strong>Jibril Omar</strong> and I am UX/UI
            designer and full-stack developer
          </h5>
          <p>
            Passionate and dedicated Web Developer with a Diploma in Enterprise
            Web & Mobile Development, I bring a diverse skill set in programming
            languages and frameworks. My recent role as a Co-op Full-stack
            Developer at Brand M3dia allowed me to play a pivotal role in an
            innovative pay kiosk project. I focused on creating a user-friendly
            interface with React, delving into the backend with Node.js and
            Express, gaining valuable insights into full-stack development, API
            integration, and effective collaboration using GitHub. As a Junior
            Full-stack Developer at Alieniz, I honed my skills in web
            development technologies. I crafted responsive interfaces using
            HTML, CSS, SCSS, bootstrap, and React JS, contributing to
            server-side logic and APIs with PHP Laravel for seamless data flow.
            Committed to community service, I volunteered at the Somali Refugee
            Centre in Malaysia, emphasizing empathy and the use of technology to
            empower those in need. My educational background includes accounting
            studies at Sanaâ€™a University, a Diploma in Enterprise Web & Mobile
            Developer program at triOS College, and Coursera certifications in
            mobile development, advanced web technologies, and various
            programming languages. Eager to contribute technical expertise,
            problem-solving abilities, and a passion for web development to a
            dynamic team, I am confident that my skills align with the Web
            Developer position. Excited about the opportunity to learn and grow
            within a forward-thinking company.
